## Project Description

The "Lifetime of a Plastic Bottle" project is a comic strip that explores the impact of plastic bottles on the environment. The overarching concept of the project is to showcase how plastic bottles continue to linger around for years, adding to the existing garbage in the environment.

We tried to achieve this by depicting the plastic bottle in the same location, while the rest of the city around it develops and changes over time. The theme of the project is centered on environmental awareness and encouraging responsible waste management.

The comic's ultimate goal is to create an engaging and educational experience for users, encouraging them to understand the impact of plastic bottles on the environment. The comic uses images and visual storytelling to convey the message effectively. We also included a button with a description of each panel to help users better understand the story and the message being conveyed.

The comic strives to create an emotional connection with the viewers, making them understand the harm that plastic bottles cause to the environment. It aims to create a sense of responsibility among users to dispose of plastic bottles properly and encourages them to adopt sustainable practices in their everyday lives.
